# YoungDevInterns_Ds_Tasks
Data Science Tasks of 01 Month Remote Internship At YoungDevInterns.

#WEEK 1 Progress:
Started by setting up the environment and loading the Titanic dataset using pandas. Practiced Python basics like using variables, data types, loops, and functions. Explored lists, dictionaries, and tuples to organize and understand data. After that, handled the dataset using pandas — checked the first few rows, summarized the data, and filled or removed missing values, such as those in the "Age" and "Embarked" columns. Finally, created simple visualizations using matplotlib and seaborn, such as line plots, bar charts, scatter plots, histograms, and boxplots to understand the data visually.

#WEEK 2 Progress : 
Cleaned the Titanic dataset — filled missing values, dropped irrelevant columns, and removed outliers in age and fare using the IQR method. I also converted a sample date to datetime format, renamed columns for clarity, and reset the index to keep the data tidy.
Then, explored patterns in the data through correlation heatmaps, group-by summaries, and visualizations like pairplots and heatmaps — which revealed useful survival trends, such as females and 1st-class passengers having higher survival rates.
Lastly, I engineered new features like age groups, family size, and extracted date parts and normalized numerical columns and encoded categorical ones to prepare the dataset for machine learning.
