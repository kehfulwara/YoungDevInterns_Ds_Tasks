# YoungDevInterns_Ds_Tasks
Data Science Tasks of 01 Month Remote Internship At YoungDevInterns.

Started by setting up the environment and loading the Titanic dataset using pandas. Practiced Python basics like using variables, data types, loops, and functions. Explored lists, dictionaries, and tuples to organize and understand data. After that, handled the dataset using pandas â€” checked the first few rows, summarized the data, and filled or removed missing values, such as those in the "Age" and "Embarked" columns. Finally, created simple visualizations using matplotlib and seaborn, such as line plots, bar charts, scatter plots, histograms, and boxplots to understand the data visually.
